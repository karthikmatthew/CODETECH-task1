## overview of the project

### Project: SIMPLE CALCULATOR

### Objectives
The objective of the project is to perform Create a Java program that acts as a basic calculator. It should prompt the user to
enter two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division). Then, it should perform the selected operation and display the result to the
user.

### Key Activities
- **Define the SimpleCalculator class**: Start by defining a class for your calculator. This class will handle user input and perform arithmetic operations.
- **Create a Scanner object**: Use the Scanner class to read input from the user. You’ll need this to get the numbers and the operator.
- **Display a menu**: Show a menu to the user, prompting them to select an operation (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
- **Perform the operation**: Depending on the user’s choice, use a switch case to perform the corresponding arithmetic operation.
  ### Technologies Used
- **JAVA**: The primary programming language for simple calculator.
- **Input**: Use the Scanner class to read two numbers from the user.
Operator: Prompt the user to enter an operator (+, -, *, or /).
- **Calculation**: Based on the operator, perform the corresponding arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
- **Output**: Display the result.
Here’s a simple example using a switch statement:
